# Linux

import { FaDocker } from 'react-icons/fa';
import { FaWindows } from 'react-icons/fa';
import { SiPostgresql } from 'react-icons/si';

Welcome to the autobrr installation walkthrough!
Follow these steps and we will have you up and running in no time.

Follow instructions below for recommended setup on a regular Linux server.
Additionally see our installation instructions for [Docker <FaDocker />](/installation/docker) and [windows <FaWindows />](/installation/windows).

import SeedboxSolutionInstallers from '/snippets/seedbox-solution-installers.mdx';

## Regular installation

### Download

import { AiFillGithub } from 'react-icons/ai';

Download the latest release, or download the [source code <AiFillGithub />](https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr/releases/latest) and build it yourself using `make build`.

```bash
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/autobrr/autobrr/releases/latest | grep download | grep linux_x86_64 | cut -d\" -f4)
```

### Unpack

```bash
sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf autobrr*.tar.gz
```

This will extract both `autobrr` and `autobrrctl` to `/usr/local/bin`.

:::info
If you do not have root, or are on a shared system, place the binaries somewhere in your home directory like `~/.bin` or use our installers for [shared seedboxes](/installation/shared-seedbox).
:::

### Configuration

Create the config dir

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autobrr
```

#### Manually configure autobrr (optional)

You can either let autobrr create the config itself at startup, or create one manually. For more information, please visit [configuring autobrr](/configuration/autobrr) which covers creating a user manually, configuring the default port, setting the desired log level, etc.

### Systemd (recommended)

On Linux-based systems, it is recommended to run autobrr as a service with auto-restarting capabilities, in order to account for potential downtime. The most common way is to do it via systemd.

You will need to create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/` called `autobrr@.service`. The `@` is important.

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/autobrr@.service
```

Then place the following content inside the file (e.g. via nano/vim/ed):

```systemd title="/etc/systemd/system/autobrr@.service"
[Unit]
Description=autobrr service for %i
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
Group=%i
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/autobrr --config=/home/%i/.config/autobrr/

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The `%i` will automatically be replaced with your user when you call `systemctl enable` with `@USERNAME` like below.

Start the service. Enable will make it startup on reboot. Replace `USERNAME` with your username.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now autobrr@USERNAME.service
```

Make sure it's running and `active`

```bash
sudo systemctl status autobrr@USERNAME.service
```

## Reverse proxy (recommended)

It's recommended to run it behind a reverse proxy like nginx in order to get TLS, more robust authentication mechanisms and other similar benefits.

### Nginx

#### Subfolder

```nginx
location /autobrr/ {
    proxy_pass              http://127.0.0.1:7474;
    proxy_http_version      1.1;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Host        $http_host;

    #auth_basic "What's the password?";
    #auth_basic_user_file /etc/htpasswd;

    rewrite ^/autobrr/(.*) /$1 break;
}
```

:::info

The `rewrite` statement in this example is crucial for correctly setting things up when using a reverse proxy with a base path.

:::

#### Subdomain

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name autobrr.domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name autobrr.domain.com;

    include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/autobrr.domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/autobrr.domain.com/key.pem;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;

    #auth_basic "What's the password?";
    #auth_basic_user_file /etc/htpasswd;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7474;
    }
}
```

### Caddy

```nginx
example.com/autobrr/* {
    uri strip_prefix /autobrr
    reverse_proxy :7474
}
```

Don't forget to set the `baseUrl` option in the `config.toml`:

```toml
# Base url
# Set custom baseUrl eg /autobrr/ to serve in subdirectory.
# Not needed for subdomain, or by accessing with the :port directly.
#
# Optional
#
baseUrl = "/autobrr/"
```

## Done

:::info

By default autobrr listens on `127.0.0.1` which is the recommended way when running a reverse proxy, but if you want to expose it to the internet/network then you must change the `host` in the `~/.config/autobrr/config.toml` from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`.

Save the changes and restart autobrr with `sudo systemctl restart autobrr@USERNAME.service`.

:::

Now that autobrr is up and running, you should be able to visit the your web UI at `http://YOUR_IP:7474` or `http://domain.ltd:7474` and proceed with your registration/login.
