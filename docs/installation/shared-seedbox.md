# Shared Seedbox

These are instructions and installation scripts for shared seedboxes. We have support for a couple of providers out of the box and if yours are missing then please reach out on [Discord <FaDiscord />](https://discord.gg/WQ2eUycxyT) so we can add support for it.

The scripts requires some input but does most of the work.

Additionally see our installation instructions for [Linux <FaLinux />](../installation/linux.md), [Docker <FaDocker />](../installation/docker.md) and [Windows <FaWindows />](../installation/windows.md).

import SeedboxInstallers from '/snippets/seedbox-installers.mdx';

Note: Remember to head over to our [Configuration Guide](../configuration/indexers.md) to learn how to set up your indexers, IRC, and download clients after you're done installing.
