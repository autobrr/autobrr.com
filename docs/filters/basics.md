# Filters

<ConvertAutodlFilter />

Most fields can take a comma separated list like `value1, value2`.

The comma separated lists supports wildcards, where `*` means 0 or more characters and `?` means exactly one character. An example would be: `*this*,that?movie`. In this case we would match any title containing `this` (or `tHiS`) or in the second case, any title which matches exactly like `That Movie` or `tHaT MoViE` or even `THAT.MOVIE`.

If no value is specified in a field, then that field will match any/all possible values. That means if nothing but `Filter Name` and `Indexers` is given, then the filter it will match all/any releases for the specified indexers.

Please note that all filters are **case-insensitive**, so write them however you desire. Another thing to note is that it is not possible to escape wildcard fields.

:::info

If you want to match a string partially, then don't forget to use the `*` around the before/after/around what you're looking for.
If you want to match a string exactly, then try to avoid the use of the `*` wildcard character.

## General

| Field           | Description                                 | Default value |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Filter name** | The name of this filter.                    |               |
| **Enabled**     | Is this filter active?                      | false         |
| **Indexers**    | Which indexers should this filter work for? |               |

:::info

Note that all filters by default are **DISABLED** and you will have to enable them manually.

### Rules

Some basic filtering rules.

:::tip about size

Some indexers doesn't announce the size, so it needs to download the torrent file and parse it to get size if set.
autodl-irssi works like this as well. To get around this some api's will be implemented for trackers that are problematic.

For TV and movies it's advised to use filters like `resolution`, `source` and `codec` since these often have known sizes.

| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Max. size**         | Maximum torrent size allowed. Supports units such as MB, MiB, GB, etc.                                            |                      |
| **Min. size**         | Minimum torrent size allowed. Supports units such as MB, MiB, GB, etc.                                            |                      |
| **Delay**             | Number of seconds to wait before running actions.                                                                 | 0                    |
| **Priority**          | Filters are checked in order of priority. Positive and negative numbers allowed. Higher number = higher priority. | 0                    |
| **Max downloads**     | Number of max downloads as specified by the respective unit.                                                      | 0 (which means +Inf) |
| **Max downloads per** | The unit of time for counting the maximum downloads per filter.                                                   |                      |

:::info
If "Max downloads" is set, the filter will only match if you have downloaded fewer than "max downloads" items since the beginning of the "max downloads per" period. For instance, if you set "max downlods" to 3 and "max downloads per" to "day" the filter won't match unless you have downloaded fewer than 3 items since the beginning of the current day, in local time.
