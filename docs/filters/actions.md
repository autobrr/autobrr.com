# Actions

Actions are set per filter for maximum flexibility. Filters support multiple actions. Very useful if you want to send to multiple clients, or run custom commands as well.

Read more about setup of [ download clients ](../configuration/download-clients ) before continuing.

When adding, updaing or removing actions on a filter, make sure to save.

## Supported actions

  * qBittorrent
  * Deluge (v1+ and v2)
  * Radarr
  * Sonarr
  * Lidarr
  * Save to watch folder
  * Run custom commands
  * Test (logs result if matched. Does not download torrent files)

### qBittorrent

Send to one or multiple local or remote instances of qBittorrent.

Available options:
* Save path: optional
* Category: optional
* Limit download and upload speed: optional
* Add as paused: default false

If category is set, then qBittorrent will control the save path. Override save location by setting `save path`.

Built in re-announce will make sure it works with initially broken trackers.

### Deluge

Supports both v1+ and v2+ clients.

Send to one or multiple local or remote instances of Deluge.

Available options:
* Save path: optional
* Label: optional
* Limit download and upload speed: optional
* Add as paused: default false

Built in re-announce will make sure it works with initially broken trackers.

### Radarr, Sonarr and Lidarr

Autobrr supports the ability to push directly to the `*arr` suite of services.

Could be useful to do some basic filtering before sending.

Select the type, and then the client. Read more about setup in [ download clients setup ](../configuration/download-clients ).

Supports both local and remote instances.

### Test

Simple action which only logs OK.

### Watch dir

For torrent clients not yet supported this is the next best thing. Useful if you want to use rTorrent, Transmission etc

Takes a path to a writeable folder.
