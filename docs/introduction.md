With inspiration and ideas from tools like trackarr, autodl-irssi and flexget we built one tool that can do it all, and then some.

autobrr is the modern download automation tool for torrents.

## What is autobrr and how does it fit into the ecosystem?

We can start by talking about torrent trackers (hereby referred to as indexers) and maintaining ratio.
You are required to maintain a ratio with most indexers. Ratio is built by seeding your torrents.
The earlier you're seeding a torrent, the more peers you make yourself available to on that torrent.

Software like Radarr and Sonarr utilizes RSS to look for new torrents. RSS feeds are updated regularly, but too slow to let you be a part of what we call the initial swarm of a torrent. This is were autobrr comes into play.

Many indexers announce new torrents on their [IRC](/configuration/irc) channels the second it is uploaded to the site. autobrr monitors such channels in real time and grabs the torrent file as soon as it's uploaded based on certain conditions (hereby referred to as [filters](/filters)) that you set up within autobrr. It then sends that torrent file to a download client of your choice via an [action](/filters/actions) set within the filter. A download client can be anything from qBittorrent and Deluge, to Radarr and Sonarr, or a watch folder.

When your autobrr filter is set to send the torrent files to Radarr and Sonarr, they will decide if it's something they want, and then forward it to the torrent client they are set up with.

autobrr can also send matches (torrent files that meets your filter's criteria) directly to torrent clients like qBittorrent, Deluge, r(u)Torrent and Transmission. You don't need to use the \*arr suite to make use of autobrr.

### The typical workflow

1. autobrr monitors IRC channels and/or RSS feeds for new torrents that fits your criteria set within your autobrr [filters](/filters).
2. A succesful match is forwarded to your [download client](/configuration/download-clients/dedicated) via an [action](/filters/actions) set inside your filters.
3. If the download client is a torrent client, then the torrent client accepts the torrent file and starts downloading it.
4. If the download client is Radarr (or any other kind of \*arr), then Radarr will check that torrent file and see if it meets Radarr's criterias.

   Criterias like:

   - Is the movie monitored?
   - Is the torrent autobrr sent considered an upgrade of your existing version of that movie?

   Radarr will reject it if it doesn't meet its criterias.
   If Radarr accepts it, then it will forward it to its download client and handle the rest from here.

5. You are now among the very first people seeding this torrent which means you will have more peers connecting to you than if you'd be grabbing that file after the initial swarm. This results in a higher ratio on your indexers.

### RSS support for indexers without an IRC announcer

A lot of indexers do not announce new torrents in an IRC channel. You can still make use of these indexers with autobrr since it has built in support for feeds as well. We support both Torznab, Newznab, as well as regular RSS feeds.
RSS indexers are treated the same way as regular indexers within autobrr.

This isn't needed if your usecase is feeding the \*arrs only. Since they have RSS support already.

## Features

As of right now, autobrr features:

- Support for 50+ trackers with IRC announces
- RSS and Torznab/Newznab support via Prowlarr to easily get access to hundreds of indexers
- Powerful but simple filtering with RegEx support (like in autodl-irssi)
- Easy to use and mobile friendly web UI (with dark mode!) to manage everything
- Built on Go and React making autobrr lightweight and perfect for supporting multiple platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, macOS) on different architectures (e.g. x86, ARM)
- Great container support (Docker, k8s/Kubernetes)
- Database engine supporting both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Notifications (Discord, Telegram, Notifiarr)
- One autobrr instance can communicate with multiple clients (both torrent and \*arr) on remote servers
- Base path / Subfolder (and subdomain) support for convenient reverse-proxy support

Available download clients and actions

- qBittorrent (with built in re-announce, categories, rules, max active downloads, etc)
- Deluge v1+ and v2+
- rTorrent / ruTorrent
- Transmission
- Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr and Whisparr (pushes releases directly to them and gets in the early swarm, instead of getting them via RSS when it's already over)
- Watch folder
- Exec custom scripts
- Webhook

## Planned features

- Automatic cross-seeding of existing releases

## About

The development of autobrr started in Early 2020, entering rapid development in Summer 2021 due to dissatisfaction with needing 3+ tools to do one job. Autobrr has since gained quite a bit of traction and has a growing community supporting the project.

Autobrr was developed with resource consumption in mind. The software uses API calls to reduce unnecessary downloads of .torrent files from sites like BTN, RED, PTP, and GGn. On other sites, it will download the .torrent only if the information is not present in the announce message.

## Quick Start

The following considers a common use case, feeding IRC announcements for a private
tracker to a Servarr instance, as a way to illustrate how the components of autobrr fit
together and what is required to get up and running. It's not the only use case and
other use cases may require more RTFM'ing in [the configuration
docs](/configuration/autobrr).

1. [Install autobrr](/installation/linux).

   Proceed once the web UI is accessible.

2. Create a user for yourself.

   Most easily done through the initial "GUI" in the web UI when autobrr is first
   started.

3. [Register a nick on your indexer's IRC
   network](/configuration/irc#registering-with-nickserv).

4. [Group a "bot" nick with your real nick](/configuration/irc#grouping-nicks).

   This is the common case, but check your tracker's IRC documentation and adjust as
   appropriate.

5. Add an [indexer](/configuration/indexers).

6. Add a [download client](/configuration/download-clients/dedicated#sonarr).

   **NOTE**: In the context of autobrr, Servarr instances are considered download
   clients.

7. Add a [filter](/filters).

   To feed all IRC announcements to a Servarr instance to let it decide what, if
   anything, to do with the release, just add a filter with the indexer from #5
   selected and leave the rest blank. Don't forget to enable the filter.

   **NOTE**: Autobrr does nothing with received IRC announcements without at least one
   filter applied to at least one indexer.

8. Add a [filter action](/filters/actions).

   Add an action of the matching Servarr type (e.g. Sonarr type action for a Sonarr
   instance), select the "download client" that corresponds to that type from #6, give
   it a name and save.

   **NOTE**: Autobrr does nothing with received IRC announcements without at least one
   action enabled in at least one filter.

9. Double check the resulting settings so far.

   Review all the indexer, download client, and IRC network settings in the autobrr web
   UI and correct any errors and omissions. Ensure that everything but the IRC network
   is enabled.

10. Enable the IRC network.

    **NOTE**: The network will display as `unhealthy` and `network unhealthy` messages
    appear in the logs until authentication has succeeded and autobrr has successfully
    joined the announcements channel. So you may safely ignore these messages until the
    logs show further information about connecting, authenticating and joining the
    channel.

Now you can monitor the logs for announcements from IRC, pushes to the Servarr instance,
and details for what, if anything, Servarr did with the release:
