# Download Clients

Go to `Settings > Clients` to setup clients.  
Clients can be local or remote, as long as ports are open and auth available.

These are the available download clients.

- qBittorrent
- Deluge (v1+ and v2+)
- rTorrent / ruTorrent
- Transmission
- Porla
- Sabnzbd (Usenet)
- Radarr
- Sonarr
- Lidarr
- Readarr
- Whisparr

All clients have a test function to try out the connection details before saving.

Don't forget to give the client a name!

## Configure Download Clients

## qBittorrent

You can run autobrr and qBittorrent on the following setups.

- Local server
- Remote server
- Docker / container

### Local {#qbittorrent-local}

For a local client, meaning autobrr and qBittorrent **on the same server** then this should work. Check qBittorrent settings to get the `WEBUI_PORT`.

- Host: `http://127.0.0.1:WEBUI_PORT`
- TLS: disabled
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

### Remote {#qbittorrent-remote}

For a remote client, meaning autobrr and qBittorrent are **not on the same server** then things might be a bit different.

- Host: `https://myserver.brr/qbittorrent`
- TLS: enabled
- Skip TLS verification: disabled (try this first)
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

Some setups like **Swizzin** requires to also use **Basic Auth** when connecting to it from a remote server.

- Basic Auth: enabled
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

### Docker {#qbittorrent-docker}

With **Docker** / containers make sure autobrr and qBittorrent share the same network to be able to use the `container_name` as address.

- Host: `http://qbittorrent:WEBUI_PORT`
- TLS: disabled
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

## qBittorrent rules

You can define some basic rules which can improve your performance for racing etc.

- **Enabled**: Disabled by default.
- **Max active downloads**: Default 0 (unlimited). Limit the amount of active downloads, to give the maximum amount of bandwidth and disk for the downloads.
- **Ignore slow torrents**: Disabled by default.
- **Download speed threshold**: If max active downloads is hit, but download speed is below this limit, download anyway. Unit in KB/s.

## Deluge

You can run autobrr and Deluge on the following setups.

- Local server
- Remote server
- Docker / container

Deluge is split into two versions:

- `Deluge` which is v1 like `1.3.15`
- `Deluge 2` which is v2 like `2.0.0+`

Select `TYPE` then set these.

### Local {#deluge-local}

For a local client, meaning autobrr and Deluge **on the same server** then this should work. Check Deluge settings to get the `DAEMON_PORT`.

- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `DAEMON_PORT`
- TLS: disabled
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

### Remote {#deluge-remote}

For a remote client, meaning autobrr and Deluge are **not on the same server** then things might be a bit different.

- Host: `myserver.brr`
- Port: `DAEMON_PORT`
- TLS: disabled
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

Some setups like **Swizzin** requires to also use **Basic Auth** when connecting to it from a remote server.

- Basic Auth: enabled
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

### Docker {#deluge-docker}

With **Docker** / containers make sure autobrr and Deluge share the same network to be able to use the `container_name` as address.

- Host: `deluge`
- Port: `DAEMON_PORT`
- TLS: disabled
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

## Deluge rules

You can define some basic rules which can improve your performance for racing etc.

- **Enabled**: Disabled by default.
- **Max active downloads**: Default 0 (unlimited). Limit the amount of active downloads, to give the maximum amount of bandwidth and disk for the downloads.

## rTorrent / ruTorrent

You can run autobrr and rTorrent / ruTorrent on the following setups.

- Local server
- Remote server
- Docker / container

### Local {#rtorrent-local}

For a local client, meaning autobrr and ruTorrent **on the same server** try these.

Here are a couple of common ways for how to access ruTorrent. Username and password needs to be set in the url as basic auth.

- Host: `http://user:password@127.0.0.1/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php`
- Host: `http://user:password@localhost/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php`
- Host: `http://user:password@localhost/RPC2`

If you are on a shared seedbox you might need your username in the url like:

- Host: `http://user:password@localhost/USERNAME/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php`

### Remote {#rtorrent-remote}

For a remote client, meaning autobrr and rTorrent are **not on the same server** then things might be a bit different.

- Host: `http://user:password@EXTERNAL_IP/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php`
- Host: `http://user:password@mydomain.com/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php`

:::caution
Some ambiguous characters (such as @ : # % and more) may escape out of the URL.  
In this case you will have to change your password for ruTorrent to be able to add the client to autobrr.
