# Freeleech

Not all indexers implemented in autobrr support the freeleech filtering.  
This is due to the indexer simply not announcing freeleech.  

To check if you can filter for freeleech, we have put together a list for you to see if you can filter for freeleech.
Indexers under the Freeleech category only support the freeleech switch in autobrr.  
Whereas indexers under the freeleech percent category support values in the freeleech percent field.
